    <h1>Welcome to T-Project</h1>
    <p id="about-section">
    Hey there! This is my little corner of the internet where I document my journey of learning coding and build personal products to solve my daily problems. This website will be my playground for experiments, projects, and tech discoveries. I'll be sharing updates on what Iâ€™m building, lessons learned, and future plans.
